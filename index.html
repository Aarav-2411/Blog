Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie...</p>

                <p>In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective �𦣇licking�� together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

                <p>As one would assume, rainfall is a central aspect to the Amazon rainforest. Unfortunately, that rainfall has been sporadic since and lackluster in recent years spanning back to early 2002. This lack of precipitation has caused numerous problems for the rainforest. Due to the intense rainfall that usually covers the forests and the incredible amount of running water and damp atmosphere, wildfires in the rainforest haven’t historically posed much of a threat to the safety of the forest at large. However, droughts in the Amazon are becoming more and more extreme every few years, including 1997-98, 2005, 2010 and now in 2015-2016, and this is in large part due to changing rain patterns from El Niño weather cycle.</p>

                            Over the years, Sudha Murty has come across some fascinating people whose lives make for interesting stories and have astonishing lessons to reveal. Take Vishnu, who achieves every material success but never knows happiness; or Venkat, who talks so much that he has no time to listen. In other stories, a young girl goes on a train journey that changes her life forever; an impoverished village woman provides bathing water to hundreds of people in a drought-stricken area; a do-gooder ghost decides to teach a disconsolate young man Sanskrit; and in the title story, a woman in a flooded village in Odisha teaches the author a life lesson she will never forget.

                            This is not a fairy-tale. This is about real witches. Real witches don't ride around on broomsticks. They don't even wear black cloaks and hats. They are vile, cunning, detestable creatures who disguise themselves as nice, ordinary ladies. So how can you tell when you're face to face with one? Well, if you don't know yet you'd better find out quickly-because there's nothing a witch loathes quite as much as children and she'll wield all kinds of terrifying powers to get rid of them.

                            Imagine my surprise when I, Geronimo Stilton, was offered the chance to travel back in time again! Professor Paws von Volt entrusted me to lead my family on a secret journey in his new time machine.
                            <br><br>
                            This voyage took us to ancient Rome, to the great Maya Empire, and to the Palace of Versailles during the age of the Sun King! Along the way I competed in a scary chariot race, saved some mouselings from a hungry jaguar, and was forced to organize a huge party for the king who had everything. What a wild trip through history!
